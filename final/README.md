1. Three social media sites you use or are aware of:

   1. Twitter

   2. TikTok

   3. Instagram

2. Solving a problem (or pain point) - research

   1. What is the experience of your current social media sites?
      These sites are great for staying connected to the people you know and the things happening. They are offering a great platform for social influencers to share their opinions.
   2. What are the pain points of your current social media sites?
      I use them daily, and some of the problems are: 1. Scam: too many bots and scams, 2. Economy: great content can not be rewarded directly, 3. Editing: contents are rarely editable, 4. Editing: not user friendly for editing long contents, 5. Ownership: user data and posted contents cannot be transferred to another site.

3. Once you identify the problem, how do you solve it?

  1. What if you're not trying to solve a problem?
      For each problem I listed above, the priority is: 1. High, 2. High, 3. Medium, 4. Low, 5. Medium.
  2. What are the difficulty of fixing those problems?
      For each problem I listed above, the difficulty is: 1. Low, 2. Medium, 3. Medium, 4. Low, 5. Low.

4. What is the solution? How does it solve the problem?

  For each problem I listed above, the solution may be: 1. Always verify the identity of users and maybe use AI model to detect some of the scams, 2. Add API for setting the owner of a post, and make every post "purchaseable" to reward the content creators by direct selling of their posted content, 3 & 4. Optimize the experience of editing by changing the API and frontend editor tools, 5. Add an API for accessing and exporting all the contents related to a user.

5. What are the features that solve this problem?

   1. Now that you've identified the problems you can make the project stand out.
      I will be solving the second problem of Economy model of the social media sites. The approach will be adding API for setting the owner of a post, and make every post "purchaseable" to reward the content creators by direct selling of their posted content.
